### Geolocating addresses in R

We're going to start with geolocating municipal police stations in Connecticut.

We'll be using the [`ggmap` package](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap) for a lot of functions, starting with geolocating addresses with Google Maps.

```{r loading_packages, warning=F, message=F}
# if you don't have the following packages installed, uncomment and run the lines below

#install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "tidyr", "ggmap", "DT", "knitr", "readr"))

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(ggmap)
library(DT)
library(knitr)
```

```{r geolocating}
stations <- read_csv("data/Police_Departments.csv")
glimpse(stations)
```

----

To find the latitude and longitude of an address, we need a full address like you would put into Google Maps. This data frame has a separate column for each piece of the address.

We need a single column for addresses, so we'll concatenate *ADDRESS*, *CITY*, *STATE*, and *ZIP*. 

{{% notice important %}}
Did you notice the zip code is numeric and has only 4 digits out of 5 for zip code? That's because Connecticut zipcodes all start with 0. We'll need to put that 0 back for the geocoding to work successfully.
{{% /notice %}}

```{r geolocating2, eval=F}
stations <- stations %>% 
  mutate(ZIP=paste0("0", as.character(ZIP))) %>% 
  mutate(location = paste0(ADDRESS, ", ", CITY, ", CT ", ZIP))
```

The function to geocode a single address is `geocode()` but we've got a bunch of addresses, so we can use `mutate_geocode()`.

```{r geocode, eval=F}
geo <- mutate_geocode(stations, location)
```

```{r geo, warning=F, message=F}
# If it's taking too long, you can cancel and load the output by uncommenting the line below
geo <- read_csv("data/geo_stations.csv")

# Bringing over the longitude and latitude data
stations$lon <- geo$lon
stations$lat <- geo$lat
```

This is using Google's service, and last I checked there were about 2,500 queries allowed per day if you don't have a key. If you do get a key, check out the documentation at the bottom of [this page](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap).

**Also** did you know that Google let's you reverse geocode?

If you pass latitude and longitude data to `revgeocode()` it will return an address.

```{r reverse_geocode, warning=F, message=F}
revgeocode(c(lon = -77.030137, lat = 38.902986))
```


### Plotting points with ggplot2

Let's pull town shapes for Connecticut with **tigris**.

```{r tigris_ct, warning=F, message=F, quietly=T, echo=T, results='hide'}
# If you don't have tigris or ggplot2 or sf installed yet, uncomment and run the line below
#install.packages("tigris", "sf", "ggplot2")

library(tigris)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)

# set sf option

options(tigris_class = "sf")

ct <- county_subdivisions("CT", cb=T)

#If cb is set to TRUE, download a generalized (1:500k) counties file. Defaults to FALSE (the most detailed TIGER file).

ggplot(ct) + 
  geom_sf() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = 'transparent')) +
  labs(title="Connecticut towns")
```

Okay, we've got the shapefile. 

We just add the geolocated points like it was dots on a chart. Because that's essentially what latitude and longitude is.

```{r map_chart, fig.width=9, fig.height=5, warning=F, message=F}

ggplot(ct) + 
  geom_sf() +
  geom_point(data=stations, aes(x=lon, y=lat), color="blue") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = 'transparent')) +
  labs(title="Police stations")
```

Alright, I'll throw in grouping for Description.

And generate some random numbers for staffing for each station so we can make some circle plots.

```{r map_chart2, fig.width=9, fig.height=5, warning=F, message=F}
set.seed(7)

stations$staff <- sample(200, size=nrow(stations), replace=T)

ggplot(ct) + 
  geom_sf(fill="transparent") +
  geom_point(data=stations, aes(x=lon, y=lat, size=staff, color=DESCRIPTION),  fill="white", shape=1) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = 'transparent')) +
  labs(title="Police stations in Connecticut") +
  coord_sf()
```

I also threw in `coord_sf()` in there at the end. It makes sures that all layer are using a common *CRS*. It sets it based on the first layer.

You can set other [projections](That https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsf.html) easily.
