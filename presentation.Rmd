## Stealing from myself

This is from the [fifth chapter](https://learn.r-journalism.com/en/mapping/static_maps/static-maps/) of [learn.r-journalism.com](https://learn.r-journalism.com/).


To follow along

```
install.packages("usethis")
```

and then

```
usethis::use_course("https://github.com/r-journalism/learn-chapter-5/archive/master.zip")
```

This presentation is in `presentation.RMD` and the script with just the code is in `static_maps/static_maps.R`


## The plan

We'll walk through several methods for dealing with spatial data, each time improving on the style a little bit.

1. Map blank shapefile after downloading
2. Join Census data to blank shapefile and map
3. Use R package **Tigris** to download shape file
4. Use R package **censusapi** to download census data and join to new shape file
5. Use **tidycensus** to download Census data and the shape file all at once

## Shape files

R can handle importing different kinds of file formats for spatial data, including KML and geojson. 

All files must be present in the directory and named the same (except for the file extension) to import correctly.


## sf 

- An older package, **sp**, lets a user handle both vector and raster data
- **sp** and **sf** packages are how they store CRS information 
    - While **sp** uses spatial subclasses, **sf** stores data in dataframes, allowing it to interact with **dplyr** 
    
## macs

There are performance issues when creating maps with the **sf** package **if you're using a Mac**. 

To fix, download and intall [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/). Restart and then run these commands: 

```
options(device = "X11")
``` 

and then 

```
X11.options(type = "cairo")
```

## Mapping a simple shape file

We'll start by reading in a shapefile of state boundaries from the [Census](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-cart-boundary.html). 

`st_read()`

```{r simple_states, warning=F, message=F}
# If you haven't installed ggplot2 or sf yet, uncomment and run the lines below
#install.packages("ggplot2")
#install.packages("sf")

library(ggplot2)
library(sf)

# If you're using a Mac, uncomment and run the lines below
#options(device = "X11") 
#X11.options(type = "cairo")

fifty_location <- "static_maps/data/cb_2017_us_state_20m/cb_2017_us_state_20m.shp"
fifty_states <- st_read(fifty_location)
```

## Fifty states as a dataframe

```{r view_fifty, eval=F}
View(fifty_states)
```

![](static_maps/images/view1.png)

## Mapping the shape file

`geom_sf()`

```{r plot_fifty_simple, fig.width=9, fig.height=5}
ggplot(fifty_states) + geom_sf()
```

## Adding data to the map

Let's pull in population data from [CensusReporter.org](https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B02001&geo_ids=040|01000US)

```{r import_pop_csv, warning=F, message=F}
# If you don't have readr installed yet, uncomment and run the line below
#install.packages("readr")

library(readr)
populations <- read_csv("static_maps/data/acs2016_1yr_B02001_04000US55.csv")
```

![](static_maps/images/view2.png)

## Join data to the map

```{r join_data1, warning=F, message=F}
ncol(fifty_states)

library(dplyr)

fifty_states <- left_join(fifty_states, populations,
                          by=c("NAME"="name"))
```

```{r viewfifty}
ncol(fifty_states)
```


## What's in it

* **STATEFP** is the state fips code. 
* **GEOID** is also part of the fips code. 
* **B02001001**, **B02001002**, etc.
    * This is reference to a Census table of information.
* **B02001001, Error**
* **geometry** 
    * This is the CRS data
    
## geom_sf


```{r joined_map, fig.width=9, fig.height=5}
forty_eight <- fifty_states %>% 
  filter(NAME!="Hawaii" & NAME!="Alaska" & NAME!="Puerto Rico")

ggplot(forty_eight) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill=B02001001)) +
  scale_fill_distiller(direction=1, name="Population") +
  labs(title="Population of 48 states", caption="Source: US Census")
```



## Downloading shape files directly into R

Let's use the [**tigris**](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris) package, which lets us download [Census shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html) directly into R without having to unzip and point to directories, etc.

Shapefiles can be downloaded simply by referring to them as a function such as

* `tracts()`
* `counties()`
* `school_districts()`
* `roads()`

## Downloading Texas

First, let's make sure the shapefiles download as **sf** files (because it can also handle **sp** versions, as well)

```{r tigris_install, warning=F, message=F, quietly=T, echo=T, results='hide'}
# If you don't have tigris installed yet, uncomment the line below and run
#install.packages("tigris")

library(tigris)

# set sf option

options(tigris_class = "sf")

tx <- counties("TX", cb=T)

# If cb is set to TRUE, download a generalized (1:500k) counties file. 
# Defaults to FALSE (the most detailed TIGER file).

# Excluding Non-Continguous states (sorry!)
```

## Mapping Texas

```{r texas_again}

ggplot(tx) + 
  geom_sf() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = 'transparent')) +
  labs(title="Texas counties")
```

## Downloading Census data into R via API


First, sign up for a [census key](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).

```{r census_key, eval=F}
# Add key to .Renviron
Sys.setenv(CENSUS_KEY="YOURKEYHERE")
# Reload .Renviron
readRenviron("~/.Renviron")
# Check to see that the expected key is output in your R console
Sys.getenv("CENSUS_KEY")
```

```{r loading_my_key, echo=F}
source("static_maps/key.R")
Sys.setenv(CENSUS_KEY=census_key)
readRenviron("~/.Renviron")
```
    
## Loading censusapi

```{r load_censusapi, warning=F, message=F}
# If you don't have censusapi installed yet, uncomment the line below and run
#install.packages("censusapi")

library(censusapi)
```

Check out the dozens of data sets you have access to now.

```{r vewapi, eval=F}
apis <- listCensusApis()
View(apis)
```

![](static_maps/images/apis.png)

## getCensus()

These are the arguments you'll need to pass it:

* `name` - the name of the Census data set, like "acs5" or "timeseries/bds/firms"
* `vintage` - the year of the data set
* `vars` - one or more variables to access (remember *B02001001* from above?)
* `region` - the geography level of data, like county or tracts or state

## listCensusMetadata()

Real quick, let's use `listCensusMetadata()` to see what tables might be available from the ACS Census survey.


```{r metadata, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
# you'll need the dev version of censusapi for this to work
#install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("hrecht/censusapi")

acs_vars <- listCensusMetadata(name="acs/acs5", type="variables", vintage=2016)

View(acs_vars)
```
![](static_maps/images/race.png)

## Downloading median income

We'll pull median income: *B21004_001E*

```{r median_income, warning=F, message=F}
tx_income <- getCensus(name = "acs/acs5", vintage = 2016, 
    vars = c("NAME", "B19013_001E", "B19013_001M"), 
    region = "county:*", regionin = "state:48")
head(tx_income)
```

## Joining and mapping


```{r, tx_income, warning=F, message=F}
# Can't join by NAME because tx_income data frame has "County, Texas" at the end
# We could gsub out the string but we'll join on where there's already a consistent variable, even though the names don't line up

tx4ever <- left_join(tx, tx_income, by=c("COUNTYFP"="county"))

ggplot(tx4ever) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill=B19013_001E), color="white") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = 'transparent')) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette="Oranges", direction=1, name="Median income") +
  labs(title="2016 Median income in Texas counties", caption="Source: US Census/ACS5 2016")
```



## Download Census data and shapefiles together

The most recent package dealing with Census data is [**tidycensus**](https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/index.html).

But querying the data with `get_acs()` will be easy and so will getting the shape file by simply passing it `geometry=T`.

```{r tidycensus, warning=F, message=F}
# if you don't have tidycensus installed yet, uncomment and run the line below

#install.packages("tidycensus")
library(tidycensus)

# Pass it the census key you set up before
```

```{r key, eval=F}
census_api_key("YOUR API KEY GOES HERE")
```

```{r loading_my_key2, echo=F}
census_api_key(census_key)
```

## Jersey


```{r racejobvars, warning=F, message=F, quietly=T, echo=T, results='hide'}
jobs <- c(labor_force = "B23025_005E", 
              unemployed = "B23025_002E")

jersey <- get_acs(geography="tract", year=2016, variables= jobs, county = "Hudson", 
                  state="NJ", geometry=T)

head(jersey)
```

## Calculating unemployment

```{r unemployed_nj, warning=F, message=F}
library(tidyr)

unemp_jersey <- jersey %>% 
  mutate(variable=case_when(
    variable=="B23025_005" ~ "Unemployed",
    variable=="B23025_002" ~ "Workforce")) %>%
  select(-moe) %>% 
  spread(variable, estimate) %>% 
  mutate(percent_unemployed=round(Unemployed/Workforce*100,2)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(fill=percent_unemployed)) + 
  geom_sf(color="white") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = 'transparent')) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette="Reds", direction=1, name="Estimate") +
  labs(title="Percent unemployed in Jersey City", caption="Source: US Census/ACS5 2016") +
  NULL
```

## Unemployment in Jersey

```{r jersey}
unemp_jersey
```

## Faceting

Ethnicity population


```{r facet, warning=F, message=F, quietly=T, echo=T, results='hide'}
racevars <- c(White = "P0050003", 
              Black = "P0050004", 
              Asian = "P0050006", 
              Hispanic = "P0040003")

harris <- get_decennial(geography = "tract", variables = racevars, 
                  state = "TX", county = "Harris County", geometry = TRUE,
                  summary_var = "P0010001") 

head(harris)
```

## Harris County


```{r faceting, warning=F, message=F}
# If you dont have the viridis package installed yet, uncomment and run the line below
#install.packages("viridis")

library(viridis)

hc <- harris %>%
  mutate(pct = 100 * (value / summary_value)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill = pct, color = pct)) +
  facet_wrap(~variable) +
  geom_sf() +
  coord_sf(crs = 26915) + 
  scale_fill_viridis(direction=-1) +
  scale_color_viridis(direction=-1) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = 'transparent')) +
  labs(title="Racial geography of Harris County, Texas", caption="Source: US Census 2010")
```

## hc

```{r hc}
hc
```

## What about Alaska and Hawaii?

If you pass `shift_geo=T` to the `get_acs()` function in **tidycensus** then the states will be repositioned.


```{r alaska_hawii, warning=F, message=F, quietly=T, echo=T, results='hide'}
county_pov <- get_acs(geography = "county",
                      variables = "B17001_002",
                      summary_var = "B17001_001",
                      geometry = TRUE,
                      shift_geo = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(pctpov = 100 * (estimate/summary_est))

ak_hi <- ggplot(county_pov) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = pctpov), color=NA) +
  coord_sf(datum=NA) +
  labs(title = "Percent of population in poverty by county",
       subtitle = "Alaska and Hawaii are shifted and not to scale",
       caption = "Source: ACS 5-year, 2016",
       fill = "% in poverty") +
  scale_fill_viridis(direction=-1)
```

## Hello Alaska and Hawaii

```{r ak_hi}
ak_hi
```
